A_simulation_of_artificial_neutral_gas-dust_plasma_in_the_ionosphere

  Spatial distribution of depletion structure produced by neutral gas


  Spatial distribution of "squid-like" depletion structures produced by gas-solid mixed injection into the ionosphere


 Used to calculate TEC

 Used to simulate rocket trajectory

 Used to simulate the electron density profile after being disturbed
